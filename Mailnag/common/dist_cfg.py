# This file contains constants that need to be adjusted for propper distro integration.

# Application version displayed in the 
# about dialog of the config window.
APP_VERSION = '2.2.1'

# The PACKAGE_NAME constant is used to configure
# 1) the path where all app data (glade files, images) is loaded from
#    (usually /usr/share/<PACKAGE_NAME>) via get_data_file() (see utils.py). 
# 2) paths for localization files generated with gen_locales
#    (usually /usr/share/locale/<LANG>/LC_MESSAGES/<PACKAGE_NAME>.mo).
# Typically, there's no need to touch this constant.
PACKAGE_NAME = 'mailnagger'

# The LOCALE_DIR constant specifies the root path for localization files
# (usually you have to make it point to '/usr/share/locale').
LOCALE_DIR = './locale'

# The DESKTOP_FILE_DIR constant specifies the root path for .desktop files
# (usually you have to make it point to '/usr/share/applications').
DESKTOP_FILE_DIR = './data'

# The LIB_DIR constant specifies the root path for the Mailnag python files
# (usually you have to make it point to <PYTHON_LIB_DIR>/Mailnag).
LIB_DIR = './Mailnag'

# The BIN_DIR constant specifies the path for the mailnag start scripts
# (usually you have to make it point to '/usr/bin').
