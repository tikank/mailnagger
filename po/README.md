Mailnagger translations
=======================

Mailnagger uses gettext tools for translations.

There is not currently any traslation service for Mailnagger.

If you want to translate or update texts, I suggest to clone
Mailnagger git repo, create and update po file, and then make
pull request.

Or contact me: Timo Kankare <timo.kankare@iki.fi>
